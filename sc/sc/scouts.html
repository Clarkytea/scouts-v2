         <h3><span class="second">SCOUTS...</span></h3>
         <p>Scouts are for boys and girls age 10½ to 14½. The troop meet on Monday evenings from 19:45 to 21:15.<p>
           <p>Scouts is all about fun and adventure while learning life skills, responsibility and independence. At 1st Owlsmoor we plan a programme which includes hikes, camping, firelighting and cooking as well as activities such as climbing, kayaking, skiing at John Nike and scuba diving. We also join the Beavers and Cubs for trips and camps as a Group.<p>
           <p>We may not be able to offer your child a place immediately, however feel free to contact us and we can advise you of when a place may become available.<p>
           <p>Full uniform is expected every week unless otherwise specified, details of where to buy uniform is below. Scouts should bring a change of suitable clothes to each meeting. Appropriate footwear is to be worn at all times.
           If you have skills that you want to share with us please let us know.<p>

        <h3><span class="second">IMPORTANT INFORMATION</span></h3>
        <p>We have been informed that the School Gates will be locked every night at 20:00hrs. This action is necessary due to the amount of vandalism that has taken place at the School.<p>
        <p>When dropping your son/daughter in the car park please make sure before you leave that the Troop Meeting is actually taking place as you assume it will be.<p>
        <p>There is now a signing-in and signing-out book at the entrance table in the hallway for parents to use. If your son / daughter walks to or from the Scout meeting on their own, or shares a lift with
          another Scout, we will require written permission as the Scout will be responsible for signing themselves in and out.<p>
          Subs are £32 per Term.
