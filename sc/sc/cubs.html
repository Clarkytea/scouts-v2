         <h3><span class="second">CUBS...</span></h3>
         <p>Cubs are for boys and girls age 8 to 10½. The pack meet on Monday evenings from 18:00 to 19:30.<p>
         <p>Cubs is all about fun and adventure while learning life skills, responsibility and independence. At 1st Owlsmoor we plan a programme which includes hikes, camping, firelighting and cooking as well as activities such as climbing, dragon boating and archery. We also join the Beavers and Scouts for trips and camps such as parent camp which is in September each year.<p>
         <p>We may not be able to offer your child a place immediately, however feel free to contact us and we can advise you of when a place may become available.<p>
         <p>Full uniform is expected every week unless otherwise specified, details of where to buy uniform is below. Appropriate footwear is to be worn at all times.<p>

        <h3><span class="second">IMPORTANT INFORMATION</span></h3>
        <h5>Cub's Code of Conduct</h5>
        <p>Towards the end of last term the leaders noticed that behaviour was not what is expected at Cubs. The leaders are going to implement the following and hopefully this will resolve this issue. I am asking all parents to support us as this should make Cubs more enjoyable for all that attend including the adults.<p>
        <h5>Cub’s Dress Code</h5>
        <p>This term we will be awarding each Six with points for behaviour, dress and participation. At the end of each term the winning Six will receive a prize for everyone in the Six linked to Scouting. To remind you I have detailed this below.<p>
        <h5>Cub Uniform:</h5>
        <p>Group scarf (ironed, neatly rolled and held in place with a woggle)<p>
        <p>Green Cub sweatshirt<p>
        <p>Scout navy cargo trousers or suitable trousers for activities not jeans<p>
        <p>Shoes or trainers suitable for activities<p>
        <p>We will be selling second-hand uniform at the tuck shop, or it can be purchased from three local Scout shops.<p>
